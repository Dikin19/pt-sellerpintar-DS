# Authentication Persistence Fix

## Problem

Users had to login again after every page refresh because the authentication state was not properly persisted and restored.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **API Route Issue**: The `getCurrentUser()` function was failing with 404 errors
2. **Poor Token Validation**: No proper token expiration checking
3. **Inadequate Error Handling**: Auth errors weren't handled gracefully
4. **Missing Response Interceptor**: No automatic token cleanup on 401 errors

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Axios Configuration (`src/lib/axios.ts`)

- Added response interceptor to handle 401 errors automatically
- Automatic token cleanup and redirect on authentication failures
- Better error handling for expired tokens

### 2. Improved Authentication Context (`src/contexts/auth-context.tsx`)

- Added token expiration validation using JWT payload
- Better fallback mechanism using saved user data when API fails
- Improved error handling and logging
- Enhanced cookie settings with SameSite attribute

### 3. Updated getCurrentUser API (`src/lib/api.ts`)

- Changed to use local API route `/api/auth/me` instead of direct backend call
- Added proper environment checks for browser-only operations
- Better error handling with descriptive messages

### 4. Enhanced RoleGuard Component (`src/components/auth/role-guard.tsx`)

- Added automatic redirect to login for unauthenticated users
- Better loading states and user feedback
- Improved permission checking logic

### 5. Updated Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)

- Better public route handling
- Simplified authentication logic
- Proper redirection for protected routes

### 6. Added Debug Utilities (`src/lib/auth-debug.ts`)

- Development-only debugging tools
- Token inspection and validation checks
- Available globally as `window.debugAuth()` in development

## How It Works Now

1. **Initial Load**:

   - Checks for existing token in localStorage
   - Validates token expiration
   - Attempts to fetch fresh user data from API
   - Falls back to saved user data if API fails but token is valid

2. **Token Management**:

   - Automatic cleanup of expired tokens
   - Response interceptor handles 401 errors globally
   - Token stored in both localStorage and cookies

3. **State Persistence**:

   - User remains logged in across page refreshes
   - Authentication state persists until token expires or manual logout
   - Graceful handling of API failures

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Automatic redirect to login on authentication failures
   - Clear error messages for debugging
   - Fallback mechanisms for temporary API issues

## Usage

After these fixes, users will:

- Stay logged in across page refreshes
- Be automatically redirected to login only when tokens are expired or invalid
- See proper loading states during authentication checks
- Have a smoother user experience with better error handling

## Debug Commands (Development Only)

In the browser console, you can use:

```javascript
debugAuth(); // Shows current auth state, token info, and expiration
```

This will help diagnose any authentication issues during development.
